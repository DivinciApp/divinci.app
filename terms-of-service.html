                        "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>"), which
                        offers web and mobile applications, as well as SMS
                        services powered by off-the-shelf and custom language
                        models. By accessing or using our services, including
                        any AI-generated content or responses (the
                        "<strong>Services</strong>"), you agree to be bound by
                        these Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access
                        or use the Services.

                    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        To use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old
                        and capable of entering into a legally binding
                        agreement. By using the Services, you affirm that you
                        meet these requirements.

                    <p>
                        Our Services allow users to interact with AI-powered
                        language models, including pre-trained models (e.g.,
                        GPT-3, ChatGPT) and custom fine-tuned models with
                        retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These
                        models can assist with a range of queries and tasks but
                        do not provide expert advice. Users should not rely
                        solely on the content provided by the AI models for
                        important decisions, including those relating to health,
                        finance, legal, or other professional fields.

                        compliance with applicable laws. You will not use the

                    <p>
                        The AI models provided through the Services generate
                        content based on user prompts. However, AI-generated
